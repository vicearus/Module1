# <Module1: Code readbility and accessibility>

## Description

This assignment was done to practice writing code that is organized, readable, and meets accessibility standards. The code was organized to have a logical flow going from header to content to footer. Semantic elements were used to aid in the identification of blocks of code. Selectors in CSS with similar functionality were consolidated where possible. Finally, alt attributes were added to images to meet accessibility standards.
By modifying code to fit these criteria, the code is more easily understood and facilitates collaboration with other team members.

## Usage

Follow the use of comments and semantic elements shown in this code to see how to create code that even new coders can understand.
